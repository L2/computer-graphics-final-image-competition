This assignment is open-ended and creative. The task is simply to make a
computer graphics image, video, animation, or interactive experience.

The student with the best result will be awarded the "best in show" trophy.

## Ground rules

You may use external code, models or other assets so long as you acknowledge
your sources. Keep in mind your entry will be judged according to the _delta_ of
the part you implemented over any existing code/assets.

You are encouraged (but not required) to start with one of the existing
assignments and expand its functionality.

Ultimately, your code needs to produce a visual artifact: image, video animation
or screen recording of an interaction.

## Tasks

Your submission has three parts:

### `submission/README.md`

A short readme describing the work _you've_ done and an acknowledgment of any
existing code/assets you've _not_ done yourself.

### `submission/source.zip`

A [.zip archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) of all
source/assets needed to _reproduce_ your work

### `submission/image.png` _or_ `submission/video.mp4`

An image (as a .png) or video (as a .mp4) demonstrating your result. For
interactive experiences or games record a prototypical use as a screen
recording. Use as high resolution as possible. For example, a [Full
HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p) image is 1920×1080 pixels.
